taskTypes has a recommended solve time of 5 minutes.  I gave myself 30, but it took me 36 minutes.
I had the most difficulty with getting the integer results into the array after the loop.  In the beginning, 
I had the my index assignments right before the loop.  I used Console.WriteLine to help me see where/how the 
variables were incrementing.  Finally, I realized that I needed to move the assignment statements so that
the current values were assigned appropriately.
